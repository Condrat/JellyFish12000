The new XBee code requires the MFToolkit. Grab from:

https://mftoolkit.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest

Save it somewhere, compile the Zigbee Console sub-project.  It should produce an 
IO library and an XBee library.

Under the JellyFish12000 References under Solution Explorer add the IO and
XBee library by pointing to the compiled DLLs, e.g.:

<path_to_mftoolkit>\IO\bin\Debug\IO.dll
<path_to_mftoolkit>\Zigbee\bin\Debug\XBee.dll
